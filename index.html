            <p> 
As part of my final project, I developed a comprehensive Blood Bank 
Information Management System. The system was designed to manage blood donations, track inventory, and ensure efficient data retrieval for healthcare providers. It integrates secure user authentication, real-time blood stock tracking, and automated notifications to alert staff when blood supplies are running low. This system aims to 
streamline operations in blood banks, ensuring timely availability of blood for patients in need.!</p>

        <h2>Front End Developer</h2>
        <p>My name is Yaikob Tesgera Tujuba, and I am a passionate Computer Science undergraduate student at Jinka University in Ethiopia. With a strong foundation in networking, software development, and systems design,
		I am committed to leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and improve lives. Growing up in West Wollega, Oromia, I developed a deep interest in technology and how it can bridge gaps in underserved communities. My goal is to use my skills to drive innovation, enhance digital access, and make a meaningful impact in various sectors.

Throughout my academic journey, I have gained hands-on experience working on projects that involve web development, network installation, and machine learning. One of my notable achievements was working on the Blood Bank Information Management System, which aims to improve the efficiency of blood bank operations and ensure the timely availability of blood supplies for patients. I also gained valuable experience during my internship at the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, where I contributed to network infrastructure development and IT system optimizations.

In addition to my academic and practical work, I am Cisco certified and hold several Udacity certificates, which have provided me with in-depth knowledge in areas such as networking, cybersecurity, and software engineering. I am always eager to learn and stay updated with the latest technologies and trends in the tech industry.

Outside of my technical skills, I am passionate about graphic design, video editing, and creating digital content. I have worked on designing logos and editing videos for clients, helping them establish a strong visual presence and communicate their messages effectively.

As I continue to build my career, I am focused on creating solutions that address local challenges in Ethiopia and beyond. Whether it's developing digital systems for healthcare, creating financial technology solutions, or building community-driven educational tools, I am dedicated to using my skills to foster positive change.</p>
